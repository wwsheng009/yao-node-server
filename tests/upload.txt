this ðŸ‘‡ "Rest Client" snippet works for me (solution from here).

*Note the boundry=MfnBoundry does not use a delimiter, while --MfnBoundry is used to open it, and --MfnBoundry-- is used to close it.

POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=MfnBoundry

--MfnBoundry
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="files"; filename="test.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

< ./test.txt
--MfnBoundry--
